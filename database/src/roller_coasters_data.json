Vettel designed the Cyclone with an out and back layout that features a left hand curve drop into a helix before the out and back portion.  Also of note is the Art Deco style station, which is an attraction itself, with incredible detail and bright neon lights to draw park visitors to the ride.",

Fast steel switchbacks connect the turns just before the trains lunge into a gravity-defying 540-degree upward spiral.

Located at Belmont Park beside Mission Beach, the Giant Dipper began operating on July 4, 1925 and continued to operate until it closed in December 1976.  Shortly after closing the roller coaster was designated a National Historic Landmark which helped save it from destruction.  After 14 years of non-operation the Giant Dipper reopened after a successful preservation effort by the Save the Coaster Committee.  Once again, the restored Giant Dipper offers thrills with its curving first drop, multiple hills, sharp curves and high speeds.",

It plunges, twists and turns - giving riders an adrenaline-pumping adventure that's unlike any coaster experience in the world.Griffon will be the tallest dive coaster in the world; the first floorless dive coaster, and the first to incorporate two Immelmann loops, a second 130-foot dive and one water splash down feature.

    "description": "Herb Schmeck designed this classic junior \"figure 8\" wooden roller coaster with the family in mind.  Little Dipper may be designed for kids, but it delivers enough thrills to excite adults.  The three story tall lift hill carries the train up to begin its journey through a series of pint sized drops and hills before returing to the station.",

Thanks to the tireless efforts to preserve this roller coaster, parkgoers can continue to enjoy one of the world's best wooden coasters. Phoenix is consistently ranked as one of the top ten wooden roller coasters. The double out and back layout features great drops and plenty of airtime filled hills including the double up, double down and the bunny hops on the return run to the station.

It's also noteworthy since it requires a brakeman to operate.  Yes, there is a job that requires you to ride a roller coaster.  The brakeman sits in a designated seat on the train and his job is to control the speed of the roller coaster, by slowing or stopping it.

It is the first coaster of its kind in the Americas and only the third in the world. Similar diving coasters in England and Taiwan can't match the height, speed and intensity SheiKra offers. It is also the first dive coaster to incorporate an Immelmann loop, a water feature, and a second 90-degree, 138-foot drop through an underground tunnel. The ride also includes a 360-degree climbing carousel. SheiKra's 3,188 feet of steel track offers a total ride time of just over three minutes.",

The trains are set in motion with an intensive catapult-drive (LSM) launch to speed through 4,331-feet of track, that stands just under a 100-feet high. The twisted layout and has 58 rail intersections and 116 crossovers, another record. This roller coaster offers guests multiple moments of air-time, direction changes, and plenty of near-miss moments! It's no surprise that Taron has been called one of the best steel roller coasters in Europe.",

As the car begins to ascend the second hill it then unlocks, allowing free horizontal spin - up to 20 rotations per minute.  Spider has a unique track layout that includes an 82-degree embankment called the Immelmann, a stretch of slalom track, and a 360-degree carousel turn.  The Spider roller coaster is located on the South Midway at Lagoon Park.",

Unlike traditional coasters where the trains only parallel the track, X2 is pushed to the extreme. For the first time, riders race in prototype vehicles that can spin independently 360-degree forwards or backwards on a separate axis– creating an unprecedented \"don't know what to expect next\" sensation. Perched on the edge of a massive 20-foot wide wing-shaped vehicle, riders plummet 200 feet to the ground – head-first, face down – and race at 76 mph spinning head-over-heels and performing forward and backward acrobatics through the massive 3,610-foot twisted steel maze. It's no wonder why X2 is one of the most unusual roller coasters in the world and one of the most popular attractions at Six Flags Magic Mountain.",

    "description": "High-octane thrills at Knott's Berry Farm continue with Xcelerator, a 50s themed roller coaster that uses a hydraulic motor to launch riders to an electrifying top speed of 82 miles-per-hour in just 2.3 seconds. Seated in flame-emblazoned '57 Chevys, passengers will ascend up and then back down the outside of a 205-foot tall Top Hat element at a vertical, 90-degree angle. This short, but very intense roller coaster then flies through two overbanked turns before it screams into the final brake run covering 2,202 feet of steel track in just about one minute.",
