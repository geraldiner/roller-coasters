# Roller Coasters of the World
I love roller coasters and "Ride every roller coaster in the world" is on my bucket list. I'd like to try to build a world map with all the roller coasters in the world, which you can mark with pins or different colors when you've visited them. Something like what people do in general with world maps:

# To-Do
## Build Database
* [ ] Scrape Ultimate Roller Coasters website
  - Got all the links to the individual roller coaster pages, but parsing each page is different. Especially since there aren't any clear `classes` or `ids` on the info I want/need.
* [ ] Create simple API to access later

## World Map
* [ ] Figure out how to make an interactive map with marked points for the roller coasters
* [ ] Come up with a way to "check off" one of those marked points for completion
